    <h2>What is Linguine?</h2>
    <p><em>Linguine</em> is a type of Italian pasta similar to fettuccine and trenette but elliptical in section rather than flat. It is about 4 millimetres in width, which is wider than spaghetti but not as wide as fettuccine.</p><p>The name linguine means "little tongues" in Italian, where it is a plural of the feminine linguina.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>175g linguine</li>

        <li>100ml white wine</li>
        <li>2 tbsp reduced-fat crème fraîche</li>
        <li>juice ½ lemon (or to taste)</li>
        <li>2 handfuls (150g) raw peeled prawns</li>
        <li>small bunch chives, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
